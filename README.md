# A mavenized version of yodaqa 1.6
The YodaQA system from https://github.com/brmson/yodaqa doesn't seem to support Maven. So, there we go.
I also replace DBPedia SparQL endpoint with a public endpoint. However, other hardcoded resources are present here, e.g., http://dbp-labels.ailao.eu, so the CluesToConcept parts won't work for now.
